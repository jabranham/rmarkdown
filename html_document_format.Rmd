## Overview

To create an HTML document from R Markdown you specify the `html_document` output format in the front-matter of your document:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    author: John Doe
    date: March 22, 2005
    output: html_document
    ---

## Table of Contents

You can add a table of contents using the `toc` option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the `toc_depth` option. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 2
    ---

If the table of contents depth isn't explicitly specified then it defaults to 3 (meaning that all level 1, 2, and 3 headers will be included in the table of contents).

You can add section numbering to headers using the `number_sections` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
    ---


## Appearance and Style

There are several options that control the appearance of HTML documents:

* `theme` specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme library). Valid themes include `r paste_and(rmarkdown:::themes())`. Pass null for no theme (in this case you can use the `css` parameter to add your own styles).

* `highlight` specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include `r paste_and(rmarkdown:::html_highlighters())`. Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.

* `smart` indicates whether to produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, `---` to em-dashes, `--` to en-dashes, and `...` to ellipses. Note that `smart` is enabled by default.

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: united
        highlight: tango
    ---

### Custom CSS

You can add your own CSS to an HTML document using the `css` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        css: styles.css
    ---

If you want to provide all of the styles for the document from your own CSS you set the `theme` (and potentially `highlight`) to null:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: null
        highlight: null
        css: styles.css
    ---

You can also target specific sections of documents with custom CSS by adding ids or classes to section headers within your document. For example the following section
header:

    ## Next Steps {#nextsteps .emphasized}

Would enable you to apply CSS to all of its content using either of the following CSS selectors:

    #nextsteps {
       color: blue;
    }

    .emphasized {
       font-size: 1.2em;
    }


## Figure Options

There are a number of options that affect the output of figures within HTML documents:

* `fig_width` and  `fig_height` can be used to control the default figure width and height (7x5 is used by default)

* `fig_retina` Specifies the scaling to perform for retina displays (defaults to 2, which currently works for all widely used retina displays). Note that this only takes effect if you are using knitr >= 1.5.21. Set to `null` to prevent retina scaling.

* `fig_caption` controls whether figures are rendered with captions

* `dev` controls the graphics device used to render figures (defaults to png)

For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        fig_width: 7
        fig_height: 6
        fig_caption: true
    ---


## MathJax Equations

By default [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the `mathjax` option to control how MathJax is included:

* Specify "default" to use an https URL from the official MathJax CDN.

* Specify "local" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using "local" you also need to set the `self_contained` option to false.

* Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location.

* Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely.

For example, to use a local copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: local
        self_contained: false
    ---

To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: "http://example.com/mathjax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"
    ---

To exclude MathJax entirely:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        mathjax: null
    ---

## Document Dependencies

By default R Markdown produces standalone HTML files with no external dependencies, using data: URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. This means you can share or publish the file just like you share Office documents or PDFs. If you'd rather have keep depenencies in external files you can specify `self_contained: false`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        self_contained: false
    ---

Note that even for self contained documents MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of it's size). If you want to serve MathJax locally then you should specify `mathjax: local` and `self_contained: false`.

One common reason keep dependencies external is for serving R Markdown documents from a website (external dependencies can be cached separately by browsers leading to faster page load times). In the case of serving multiple R Markdown documents you may also want to consolidate dependent library files (e.g. Bootstrap, MathJax, etc.) into a single directory shared by multiple documents. You can use the `lib_dir` option to do this, for example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        self_contained: false
        lib_dir: libs
    ---

## Advanced Customization

### Keeping Markdown

When knitr processes an R Markdown input file it creates a markdown (md) file which is subsequently tranformed into HTML by pandoc. If you want to keep a copy of the markdown file after rendering you can do so using the `keep_md` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        keep_md: true
    ---

### Includes

You can do more advanced customization of output by including additional HTML content or by replacing the core pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body you use the `includes` option as follows:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        includes:
          in_header: header.html
          before_body: doc_prefix.html
          after_body: doc_suffix.html
    ---

### Custom Templates

You can also replace the underlying pandoc template using the `template` option:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        template: quarterly_report.html
    ---

Consult the documentation on [pandoc templates](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/templates.html) for additional details on templates. You can also study the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html) as an example.

### Markdown Extensions

By default R Markdown is defined as all pandoc markdown extensions with the following tweaks for backward compatibility with the markdown package:

```
+autolink_bare_uris
+ascii_identifier
+tex_math_single_backslash
```

You can enable or disable markdown extensions using the `md_extensions` option (you preface an option with `-` to disable and `+` to enable it). For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        md_extensions: -autolink_bare_uris+hard_line_breaks
    ---

The above would disable the `autolink_bare_uris` extension and enable the `hard_line_breaks` extension. 

For more on available markdown extensions see the [pandoc markdown specification](http://pandoc.org/README.html#pandocs-markdown).

### Pandoc Arguments

If there are pandoc features you want to use that lack equivilants in the YAML options described above you can still use them by passing custom `pandoc_args`. For example:

    ---
    title: "Habits"
    output:
      html_document:
        pandoc_args: [
          "--title-prefix", "Foo",
          "--id-prefix", "Bar"
        ]
    ---

Documentation on all available pandoc arguments can be found in the [pandoc user guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#options).

## Shared Options

If you want to specify a set of default options to be shared by multiple documents within a directory you can include a file named `_output.yaml` within the directory. Note that no YAML delimeters or enclosing output object are used in this file. For example:

**\_output.yaml**

```yaml
html_document:
  self_contained: false
  theme: united
  highlight: textmate
```

All documents located in the same directory as `_output.yaml` will inherit it's options. Options defined explicitly within documents will override those specified in the shared options file.

## HTML Fragments

If want to create an HTML fragment rather than a full HTML document you can use the [`html_fragment`](html_fragment_format.html) format. For example:

    ---
    output: html_fragment
    ---

Note that there is no title or author because fragments don't contain the standard header content that HTML documents do. HTML fragments are typically used for including snippets of HTML within larger web sites (e.g. blogs).

For additional information see the article on [HTML Fragments](html_fragment_format.html). Note that another good option for generating content to be included in larger websites is the [`md_document`](markdown_document_format.html) format, which generates markdown. For more information on this format see the article on [Markdown Documents](markdown_document_format.html).


## Creating a Website

It's possible to create full websites with R Markdown using a combination of the options described above. To create a website you need to:

1. Create a shared options file (_output.yaml) to ensure common options across all pages within the site.

2. Specify includes for common header and footer content.

3. Specify that documents are not `self_contained` and define a common `lib_dir` for JavaScript and CSS dependencies.

For example, here's a possible _output.yaml file for a website:

**\_output.yaml**

```
html_document:
  self_contained: false
  lib_dir: libs
  includes:
    in_header: include/in_header.html
    before_body: include/before_body.html
    after_body: include/after_body.html
```

The YAML inside individual documents then only needs to specify the document title:

    ---
    title: "Document Title"
    ---

This documentation website was created using R Markdown using the methodology described above. You can see it's source code here:

https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages

Note that in this repository the .Rmd and .md files are the source code and the .html files were generated by calling `rmarkdown::render`. The repository also includes a `Makefile` that rebuilds the entire site.

### Migrating Websites to Bootstrap 3

The [R Markdown website](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages) linked to above was originally created with version 0.3 of the **rmarkdown** package and its HTML utilized [Bootstrap 2](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) for layout and navigation. In version 0.4 of the **rmarkdown** package the embedded version of Bootstrap was upgraded to [version 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and as a result the underlying layout and navigation HTML needed to change.

If you modeled a website on the Bootstrap 2 implementation you'll also need to migrate to Bootstrap 3 to use more recent versions of **rmarkdown** to generate your site (you could of course also use [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat) or some other means of freezing package versions and continue using Boostrap 2 with an older version of the package).

Here are the steps required to migrate:

1) Install the most recent version of the **rmarkdown** package.

2) Remove the libs/bootstrap-2.3.2 directory

3) Copy the relevant sections from these files into the corresponding files within your site:

    [include/in_header.html](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/gh-pages/include/in_header.html) --- css for navbar padding and scroll position offset

    [include/before_body.html](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/gh-pages/include/before_body.html) -- copy the entire menu structure then substitute the drop-downs and menu items for your site.

4) If you used Bootstrap 2 HTML elements elsewhere within your site then read the Bootstrap 3 [migration guide](http://getbootstrap.com/migration/) and make whatever additional changes are required.

5) Re-generate the site by re-executing `rmarkdown::render` on all of the Rmd or md files (or just re-execute the Makefile if you have one).
